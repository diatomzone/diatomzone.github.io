hello and welcome to my website! :^]

i'll be using this spot to consolidate all sorts of things including information about my ocs, computer-related projects like twine games and sitebuilding notes, excellent links, and maybe even some art!

- this site works best on desktop (tested on firefox) but also supports narrow screens / mobile {{site.data.emojis.loveimages}}
- i'm always testing stuff and scooting things around, so if you find any broken images or links do let me know!

please find the navigation conveniently located at the top and bottom of each page ðŸ˜Œ

have a burg {{ site.data.emojis.burger }} and an elegant stay!
