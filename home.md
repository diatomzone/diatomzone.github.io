## waoh! explosions!

hello and welcome to my website! :^]

this flammable spot will house all sorts of things, including:

- wikipages about my ocs
- computer-related projects like sitebuilding notes and twine games
- excellent links
- and more!<sup>1</sup>

please find the navigation conveniently located at the top and bottom of each page ðŸ˜Œ

take this burg {{site.data.emojis.burger}} from super smash brothers brawl for the nintendo wii and have an elegant stay! {{site.data.emojis.loveimages}}

### bonus notes

- this site works best on desktop (tested on firefox) but also supports narrow screens/mobile ðŸ˜Ž
- things are always scooting around, so if you find any broken images or links please let me know!
