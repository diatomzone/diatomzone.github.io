## the story of the joestar family

i genuinely think jjba changed my brain chemistry, as i had never obsessed over anything with such overwhelming severity before {{site.data.emojis.reigen}}

if i had to pin down one main appeal, it would be The Flavor. coming from a sea of same-y shows and battle shonens, i was blown away -- jjba is an explosion of araki's unabashed love for flamboyant fashion, western pop culture and 70's-80's music, random wikipedia articles, and apparently, writing dialogue that does not sound like any human alive. literally king of doing whatever he wants!

joe's wackiness is not just on a superficial or aesthetic level, however. the series is a mishmash of inconsistency -- a walking contradiction<sup><a id="foottop1" href="#footbottom1">1</a></sup>, if you will!

the plots stick to simple goals while also ignoring basic logic and storytelling conventions.

jojo has some of the worst and best story endings i've ever seen.

can be so bad and confusing i forget what happened immediately after reading, or one of my favorite endings of any anime that makes me {{site.data.emojis.shannon}} {{site.data.emojis.ungalo}} when i think about it HA

certain moments and characters are filled with brilliant thematic meaning and moments of poetic cinema that were almost certainly unintentional on araki's part.
