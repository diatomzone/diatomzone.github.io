-- me, after starting y7

## what's it?

"half beat-em-up crime drama thriller, half everything BUT that" -- me again

## gameplay log

- i have played y0, yk1, yk2, y3, y4, and am currently playing y7! no spoilers please ðŸ˜Œ
- y0 was my introduction to the series{{site.data.foot.t2}} and it's my current favorite entry! it's the only one i'd give my "masterpiece" seal of approval so far, on the basis of mainplot {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}
  -  y7 is shaping up to contest the top spot, though ðŸ‘€

## the best of both worlds: balancing opposite aspects

literally THEE RANGE: THE GAME

### a linear story in an open world

these two structures seem like they'd conflict, but the rgg formula combines them to great effect!!

i've described my take as "an open world with a sense of progress". you have a concrete direction to follow, and even more about the world and characters will be revealed if you do -- but you're ENCOURAGED to disregard it at any time to explore, eat, shop, fight, play minigames, run a business, take bad selfies, help strangers with their bizarre problems... basically, enjoy the city at your own leisure!

### open world maps!

the maps themselves also strike a great balance! games are usually set in one city district (sometimes two!), tiny compared to the likes of breath of the wild -- yet they've never felt small.

they're extremely dense, packed with activity, detail, and character. kamurocho, the first and most recurring setting, is iconic -- so much effort is put into capturing the glitz and the grime, dusty parks tucked between buildings, glowing neon signs and the loud-ass noises from the pachinko parlors, respite of the docks...

fun fact: it's basically a 1-to-1 recreation of the real-life city district, to the point that fans who are visiting kabukicho in tokyo for the first time can navigate it LOL!

... the insanely-packed convenience store shelves and oden displays, the vending machine drinks ranging from real-life product placements to the enigmatic "pop gonger"...

i'm tangenting now but just in general, i really love this kind of appreciation for the mundane. the lovingly modeled-and-textured piles of garbage lining the streets... the effort rgg has put into recreating the city elevates random, overlooked objects into art -- things people researched and put so much time and effort and passion into, so that you could enjoy seeing them on your screen!

kamurocho is so iconic AND you get to see it evolve over the course of the series!!!!

### mood: now in your hands!

one of my all-time favorite things is when a work has "the range" and yakuza is a perfect example{{site.data.foot.t3}} -- balancing over-the-top violence and despair-inducing plots with

yakuza is a "serious" game also known for its comically absurd "substories" and unnecessarily wide minigame selection.

what's super interesting is that the game is NOT responsible for maintaining this delicate balance. there are no set goofs to lighten the mood between heavy scenes, like there would be in a movie -- the main plots are dead serious. instead, the player takes control to get exactly what they want -- when you want intrigue you can follow the story, and when you want nonsense, it's right there waiting for you!

## game series evolution

rgg is the first real series i've gotten into -- i had only played games that came in ones or twos{{site.data.foot.t4}}, so getting to see how the gameplay, writing, and overall production has changed over the course of a relatively long-running series (with a continuous story no less!) has been super intriguing to me! what works what doesn't and why? ðŸ¤” technology and game design are so cool!!!

### exp and upgrades

even if kiryu learns and forgets his strongest moves like 4 games in a row LMAO, the exp/upgrade system has changed every game i've played so far which is quite interesting!!

- y0
  - a feature unique to y0 is buying upgrades with money instead of exp!{{site.data.foot.t5}} on my first playthrough i finished the story with only half of the moves/stats/etc. unlocked because i spent all my money on real estate {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}} and for certainly unrelated reasons, i died in y0 exponentially more than any other entry {{site.data.emojis.reigen}}
- yk1
  - brings back the "skill tree" format from y0, except the tree categories are different and you buy with exp as per usual! on one hand i liked not splitting my funds between upgrades and business and was able to unlock everything by endgame, but the fact that 1) you run out of things to spend on and end up sitting with maxed-out 9999 exp could easily be solved with bonus health/heat/etc. unlockables which they had in the previously-released game y0...? and 2) the dragon style is strangely organized (the majima everywhere system unlocks things out of order?) and virtually useless until maxed out ðŸ¤” both of these feel like big and easily-amendable oversights!
- yk2
  - this time the unlockables are in catalog format, meaning you aren't limited by skill tree progress -- buy health 10 times in a row if you'd like! also, the exp is divided into separate categories (strength, speed, intelligence etc.) which i found convenient (it's also fun to see what foods make you smart HRGH)!
- y3
  - restrictive linear system using exp, not sure if this was carried over from the original y1/y2 games ðŸ¤”
- y4
  - much faster progression compared to previous games due to your time/effort being split between 4 separate protags -- both factors i enjoyed! the "soul orb" currency for upgrading abilities is new but works pretty standard i think! also, health and heat are not upgrades, but gained automatically upon level-up.
- y7
  - this one's turn-based so the setup is completely different, i might write about it separately {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}

CONCLUSION: as someone who can't be bothered to grind for exp, i prefer setups that let me max out my upgrades by the time i reach the finale!

### game polish

jumping from yk2 (2017, super fancy, newest? engine) to y3 (2009, remastered ps3 game) was a big blast to the past! surprisingly though, i felt the smaller, more subtle details dated y3 WAY more than the visuals!

- slower, longer street fight intros
- idk if it was just my computer but the sound balance was WACK the footsteps were so loud
- lack of "quality of life" features from the newer games, ex: you can only buy one item per restaurant visit, rendering completion a distant dream

CONCLUSION: the little things make all the difference! thank you to the past decades of games that helped us reach the current levels of convenience

### money is important

i personally need copious amounts of money to get things done in these games which is why the business minigames are so awesome HEHEHE

in yk1 i was so broke, even stocking up on healing items drained my funds... no way i could afford cabaret clubs, cool weapons, or anything like that! ðŸ˜”

### karaoke

yakuza is a rhythm game with a very long yakuza sidestory!!!

## it's so funny even when it's not supposed to be

help

## things i find to be unintentionally hilarious

- to me, there's nothing funnier and more impressive than unnecessarily high-effort spent on minor details -- a game that basically recreated an entire city block and packed it with 948504 neon signs and minigames and catchable rotatable 3d fish and real-life restaurants with photos of the foods for the selection screen and bartenders' detailed explanations of your drink's crafting process, flavor profile, and reputation among aficionados is as good as it gets, really {{site.data.emojis.reigen}}
  - and of course, infamous moments like rgg inventing bread physics so ichiban can eat a piece of bread HRGH
- i made more money from a single fight in y0 than i had in like the entirety of yk1 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
- in y0, you make so much money right off the bat that amenities -- taxis, minigames, restaurants, and unlimited amounts of healing items -- are virtually free :^)
- in y4 akiyama is the only one who can learn like 3 extra taunts because he's good at being annoying {{site.data.emojis.reigen}}

## analysis (real)

there is so much happening in these games and so much games. to the point where i can barely remember some of the plots because there were two dozen people involved and they're all dead now. it's analysis central i don't even know what to say!!! my personal liveblog/notetaking/analysis google doc is 78 pages of bullet points as of apr 2023... so it will not be pasted here {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}

### favorite extremely irrelevant discoveries

## true facts

- i think they should make a yakuza sports game where everyone plays sports and this is extremely important to me because it would be hilarious
  - perhaps it could even be a crossover like mario and sonic at the olympics
- i also think they should make a rhythm game in the style of the final fantasy "theatrythm" game which i played the demo of on switch... the simple either-button-or-joystick input scheme and AAA rhythmgame sound design makes everything SO satisfying and the unit/party style "battles" would suit our brawler cast perfectly!!!! there is so much awesome rgg music it deserves a spotlight!! also instead of the blob artstyle they should use the [pop team epic collab designs](https://tarokro.tumblr.com/post/707978474911039488/official-yakuza-x-pop-team-epic-collaboration-kuji) or even the indescribable [dead souls collab "chibis"](https://tarokro.tumblr.com/post/660335598714896385/ryu-ga-gotoku-of-the-end-x-777-townnet-mobile) because i love images that are bad for people's health
  - speaking of sound design yk2's chiming karaoke "hit" sound is way too loud and long to be a hit sound!!!!!!!!!!! can't believe they did that get outta town!! on the other hand i AM a fan of the 4-lane 1-speed note style in yk2 ðŸ¤” a much more standard format but it's standard cus it works! plus more spacing gives you a chance at more complicated maps, i'd be bad at it but a third higher difficulty level would be awesome :^o
  - you know what i hear there's dancing later on maybe it should be idol/band themed instead. kashiwagi on the keys

- {{site.data.foot.b1}} and of course, everyone's buddy ichiban takes over as protag in the 7th game!
- {{site.data.foot.b2}} coincidentally, i started playing after an extremely coincidental recommendation. if that hadn't happened... {{site.data.emojis.shannon}} much to think about!
- {{site.data.foot.b3}} i also value this characteristic in [lupin iii](/articlesdir/uncategorized/thoughts-lupin.html) ðŸ˜Œ
- {{site.data.foot.b4}} also counting same-game type deals like the smash bros series
- {{site.data.foot.b5}} "investing in yourself"?? i know i'm not the only one who has decided these guys are eating dollar bills LKJGDLKFJD
