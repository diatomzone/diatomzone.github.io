title: "yakuza 0 review / recommendation"

## summary

- YAKUZA 0 AUUGUJKDJFGUGUGFGFJ
  - yakuzas georg: the average yakuza game's writing is quite bad, yakuza 0 is an outlier and should not be counted
  - has my "masterpiece" seal of approval
    - unlike lupin/joe/everything else i like, i DO recommend this {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}

## linear story in an open world

it IS a linear story, but you're free to ignore it at any time to mess around in the city.

SO HERE'S THE DEAL: these structures seem like opposites, but the rgg formula combines them to great effect -- i'd say they even cover each other's weaknesses.

rgg is an rpg with a strictly linear story (no alternate endings, divided into chapters, even), so unlike some open-worlds/sandboxes etc. you're never left hanging without a task or sense of direction.

but whereas some linear rpg's can feel restrictive, rgg encourages you to ignore the plot, drop any task at any time to enjoy the open-world city at your own leisure -- play minigames, eat at a cafe, pursue wacky substories, etc.

regarding maps, games are usually set in one city district, which is tiny compared to worlds like breath of the wild. but considering how dense things are, they've never felt small to me. (oh and y0 doesn't have a pin-drop function, but the minimap and map menu work well)

## possible warnings

well, it's a beat-em-up crime drama set in a red light district (shrug)

y0's 1980's bubble economy setting emphasizes the nightlife/party/cabaret vibe even more than usual, so there are plenty of drunks/creeps groping and harassing women etc.

i've also heard people say y0 is one of the most violent entries, which i can see

(i wrote some more warnings in my notes if anyone wants lol)

## y0: what's the verdict?

1. is it well-made? YES!
2. do i enjoy it? YES!
3. do i recommend it? YES!

### yakuza in general

- THEE RANGE: dead-serious main campaign + comically absurd side content
- the main plots are usually excessively complex and convoluted soap-opera-type deals
  - "i was alive all along!" "i was the villain all along!" etc.
  - characters love dying instead of living up to their potential LOL
- majima and kiryu make me insane (not specifically as a ship just each in general) i love them so much they are soooooo analysis, and y0 is like THE majima game since he shines as 1 of the 2 player chars/protags

## the rest of the series?

- yakuza kiwami 1
  - playing this remake right after 0 felt like a steep downgrade... which is understandable since the original y1 was the first game (from 2005) and they didn't know it was going to be a series, so the characters got zero development and all died LMAO ðŸ˜­
  - notable for: being the first story, majima everywhere system, tiny haruka
