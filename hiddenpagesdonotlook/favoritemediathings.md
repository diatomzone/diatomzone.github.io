some of my favorite things i love to see in shows and games!

## thoughtful fight choreography

i love when people utilize the environment and character-specific abilities in their fight choreography, it's so satisfying and fun to watch!

using the setting's props and environmental hazards keeps things super fresh! otherwise it feels like the location doesn't matter and you may as well be playing final destination on repeat HAHA

different team combinations/combo abilities and hero/enemy matchups are so good too ouguggh

swag examples:

- rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtles: arcade fight with all the game-themed attacks and enemies, the over-the-top fish and ladders fight with SO many good cartoon physics gags too, each recurring villain having their own signature theme/ability sometimes even used against them)
- kipo and the age of wonderbeasts: animal-specific abilities like frog tongues (for maneuvering and team attacks), learning to use the mega bunny to foil enemies, wolf using her staff to hook __)

## THE RANGE


## my "masterpiece" seal of approval

not a trope, just some works i love and think were extremely well done!

swag examples:

- mob psycho 100
- undertale
- breath of the wild
