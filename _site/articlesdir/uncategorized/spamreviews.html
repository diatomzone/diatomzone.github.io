<p>[image description: 15 customer reviews for “spam”, with ratings out of 5 stars.</p>

<p>3 stars from Mars: Salty but not in a comforting way. However, I can respect the grind.</p>

<p>5 stars from Big birta: Sould xome to this fine astablishnent agaib</p>

<p>5 stars from Bubba of PRP: Microwave a couple of slices, piece of favorite cheese, nothing better.</p>

<p>5 stars from Mc bozo: Tadted great</p>

<p>5 stars from Spam Jamster: Top Quality hands down BEST spam everi would eat this 3 times aday 365 days a year!!!</p>

<p>5 stars from Yes o: I ok</p>

<p>5 stars from DG: It is tasty!</p>

<p>2 stars from Porgy: I took one bite then before the taste reached my brain i transcended to another realm.</p>

<p>5 stars from Rock: Breakfast, sandwiches</p>

<p>5 stars from Ike: Spam is fum</p>

<p>5 stars from GARSTER: WE SERVED IT WITH RICE AND EGGS. IT WAS EXCELLENT</p>

<p>5 stars from Giovanni: This is way better than all that steak nonsense. Ever since I was a child, all I wanted to eat was spam. You see, it all started on a warm spring day in 1984. At the time, I was only 7 years old. I was in 2nd grade, coming home after a long day of school. When I got home, I noticed that my mother had bought groceries. I was looking through them, when all of a sudden, my life changed. I saw a luxurious can, labeled “Spam.” I was very curious as to what it was, so I decided to ask my mother. She said it was a type of lunch meat. I asked if I could try it. Although it was already 4 in the afternoon, she reluctantly let me have some. We turned on the burner for the stove and put a pan on it. When I heard the sizzle of the spam cooking, it was like music to my ears. When it was done, I tried some, and before I knew it, I had finished my entire plate. The next day when I went to school, I told all my fellow classmates about Spam. They all looked at me weird, but then, a few days later, multiple of them said that they loved it. You see, my whole class started liking Spam, and before you knew it, the teacher was already bringing Spam to class for students to eat as a snack after recess. To this day, I still love Spam as much as I did nearly 37 years ago. Spam has changed my life forever, and I will continue to eat it every day until the day I die.</p>

<p>5 stars from Spmfan01: The classic SPAM flavor is very likely the best thing that humanity has to offer in the modern world. A staple of american culture, it’s hard to find a food item with as much impact on the american way of life. God himself couldn’t have done better.</p>
