<p>BECAUSE I KEEP FORGETTING HOW TO DO IT!!!</p>

<h2 id="materials">materials</h2>

<ul>
  <li>yakuza 7 steam download</li>
  <li>windows pc</li>
  <li>Kaplas80’s <a href="https://github.com/Kaplas80/ParManager">ParManager</a> to unpack the game’s PAR files</li>
  <li>a program that can open/convert the game’s DDS images into useable PNGs, i’m using <a href="https://krita.org/en/">krita</a> (my free, open source drawing program of choice!) including…</li>
  <li>Sepera-okeq’s <a href="https://github.com/Sepera-okeq/DDS-Evrika-Plugin">Krita DDS Evrika Plugin</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-1-open-game-directory">step 1: open game directory</h2>

<p>in file explorer, go to wherever you have the game downloaded, and into its data folder. for me, it’s…</p>

<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Yakuza Like a Dragon\runtime\media\data</p>

<p>you’ll see a bunch of folders, PAR files, and CFG files.</p>

<p>here we’ll look at “ui.yazawa.en.par”, which contains ui textures for the english game, among other things.</p>

<p>(textures include restaurant foods, equipment icons, enemy and employee portraits, all kinds of buttons, and even running pixel ichiban from the business minigame LOL)</p>

<h2 id="step-2-preview-par-file-contents">step 2: preview PAR file contents</h2>

<p>(to download ParManager from its github page, scroll down the righthand sidebar and click “releases”, then grab the correct ZIP file for your operating system) (somehow i always forget where the releases are)</p>

<p>extract the ParManager “ParTool.exe” and place it somewhere easily accessible, such as your desktop</p>

<p>open command prompt</p>

<ul>
  <li>drag and drop the “ParTool.exe” icon into command prompt. this will write down its path.</li>
  <li>after the path, type a space, then type “list” (without quotes), then type another space</li>
  <li>drag and drop the “ui.yazawa.en.par” file into command prompt. again, this will write down its path.</li>
</ul>

<p>the line should look like this: “[partool path] list [PAR file path]”. hit enter!</p>

<p>command prompt will return a (VERY LONG) list of every file inside your chosen PAR file. this is how you preview the contents before unpacking. ex: if you want 3d character models, you’d look for GMD files, i think.</p>

<p>(hint: you can also add “ -r” (without quotes) to the end of your command to recursively list the contents of nested PAR files)</p>

<h2 id="step-3-unpack-par-file-contents">step 3: unpack PAR file contents</h2>

<p>once you’ve found the package you want, do the same command as step 2, but without “list”</p>

<ul>
  <li>drag and drop the “ParTool.exe” icon into command prompt. this will write down its path.</li>
  <li>after the path, type a space</li>
  <li>drag and drop the “ui.yazawa.en.par” file into command prompt. again, this will write down its path.</li>
</ul>

<p>the line should look like this: “[partool path] [PAR file path]”. hit enter!</p>

<p>command prompt will unpack everything into a new folder “ui.yazawa.en.par.unpack”. it’ll show up in the directory of the PAR file you chose, so you should probably move it somewhere else in case it interferes with the game.</p>

<p>(hint: you can also add “ -r” (without quotes) to the end of your command to recursively unpack the contents of nested PAR files)</p>

<h2 id="step-4-preview-textures">step 4: preview textures</h2>

<p>crack open “ui.yazawa.en.par.unpack”! open “en”, then open “texture”.</p>

<p>it’s full of DDS images! for me, file explorer shows proper thumbnails for most all of them, so i go to view -&gt; extra large icons to get a better look as i scroll through.</p>

<p>once you find a pic you wanna open/convert…</p>

<h2 id="step-5-convert-texture">step 5: convert texture</h2>

<p>again, i’m using krita + DDS Evrika Plugin… the plugin github page has an installation tutorial around halfway down, so just follow that one, i don’t feel like typing it sorry <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" /></p>

<p>once you’ve opened krita with the plugin properly installed…</p>

<p>in the top bar, go to tools -&gt; scripts -&gt; import DDS</p>

<p>navigate to your “ui.yazawa.en.par.unpack” folder. you can also copy/paste the path from its file explorer window!</p>

<p>select the image you wanna open. you can also copy/paste the filename into the box! (sadly, it seems you can only open one image at a time)</p>

<p>click open, select the image format you want (i prefer PNGs), then click ok.</p>

<p>the image will open, yippee!</p>

<p>ctrl + shift + s to “save as”, then save it where you wanna save it!</p>

<h2 id="step-6-congratulations">step 6: congratulations!</h2>

<p>you can now open/edit/lovingly stare at your images!</p>

<p>i was able to grab y0 and y5 textures just fine using the same method. happy browsing!!! 😎</p>
