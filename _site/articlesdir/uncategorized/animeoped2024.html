<p>my nebulous ranking for the 2024 acds anime awards!!</p>

<p>openings are so interesting to me! a music video responsible for establishing the tone of the story, advertising production quality, and intriguing viewers with the promise of cool characters, awesome fights, heartwarming relationships, mysteries, gags, and whatever else – all in just 1.5 minutes! with these restrictions and intentions, it’s genuinely an art form.</p>

<p>while often overshadowed by their flashier counterparts, endings can absolutely be just as beloved! the number of eds on this list surprised me, even…!</p>

</div>

<p>(^ try skipping to 12 seconds, sorry i can’t time the embed 😔)</p>

<p>this list is not in reverse order, you WILL perceive my favorite ending of all time!!!!</p>

<p>the relative simplicity of the visuals has zero chance of dragging this from my top spot when GALNERYUS delivers their immaculate metal riffs and soaring vocals with all the energy of a supernova!!!</p>

<p>famous for dropping its intro as the episode comes to a close, overlaying and enhancing the narrator’s commentary on the latest cliffhanger, i have yet to witness anything hype-er. many a fan can attest to speedrunning the entire yorknew ark (21 eps?!) in one sitting, spurred on late into the night by the excitement of this very ending!</p>

<h2 id="2-bitter-song-to-sugar-step-kekkai-sensen-ed-1">#2: bitter song to sugar step (kekkai sensen ed 1)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3SlUmr_T4g" title="bitter song to sugar step" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>in many cases i love the music way more than the animation, but this ed holds no such discrepancy! the huge cast’s goofy dances and playful interactions are simply overflowing with personality and detail, from how sloppily yet high zepp kicks in the dance line, to people slipping and being caught or straight up stopping to do a somersault on stage.</p>

<p>combined with a lively and infectiously catchy soundtrack, this ed simply screams “FUN”! no wonder it’s so beloved people spend countless hours reanimating it for different series.</p>

<h2 id="3-us-one-piece-op-26">#3: us! (one piece op 26)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFbno_aPm0w" title="us!" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>this knocked my socks off and into the stratosphere, and i’m not even a one piece fan??? it’s one of the most gratuitously and gorgeously overanimated things i’ve seen, with a banger song to boot. the fresh artstyle highlights how opposite it feels from my impression of longrunning shounens’ subpar animation and glacial pacing.</p>

<p>it truly feels like a celebration of the world of one piece and its decades-long legacy, which is very touching.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-real-folk-blues-cowboy-bebop-ed-1">#4: the real folk blues (cowboy bebop ed 1)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ru_H5PiyfSA" title="the real folk blues" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>i’m surprised this made the list instead of “tank”, but the truth of the matter is: it’s just too good!!! the moodiness, the vibes, a contributor to and artifact of cowboy bebop’s iconic coolness and musical identity! a song i wanna belt out at the top of my lungs! everyone say thank you yoko kanno!!</p>

<p>this one’s literally a slideshow, but the monochome palette and grainy stills of spike’s mysterious past just add to the effect.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>now this is just me being biased, my favorite jojo op at first sight!</p>

<p>i have no deep reason for latching onto this one specifically, it’s simply a bop, but in hindsight it feels like a critical moment in the show’s evolution. any anime fan would agree jotaro’s the face of the series, but when you picture what jojo is famous for – colorful, musclebound men striking flamboyant poses – that’s not jotaro, and it’s definitely not the fashionable yet slim joes of later parts. the flashy whirlwind that is bloody stream is quintissentially joe, i think!</p>

<h2 id="6-sexy-adventure-lupin-iii-part-3-op-1">#6: sexy adventure (lupin iii part 3 op 1)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9sh-kTTaNM" title="bloody stream" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>(^ skip to 26:11, this is an official compilation vid 😳) (2nd version of this op to be precise)</p>

<p>again, i’m surprised my highest-ranked lupin is the only part 2-6 op that’s not THEE immortal lupin iii theme, but in a series as long as this one, standing out is a risk that can pay off big time – and sexy adventure does just that!</p>

<p>it’s part 3’s “wonky” character designs hitting peak cross-eyed, bendy-limbed cartoon in a neon, chewy, bubblegum-flavored 80’s explosion, with a certified yuji ohno banger to match! beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!</p>

<h2 id="7-lupin-iii-80-lupin-iii-part-2-op-4">#7: lupin iii ‘80 (lupin iii part 2 op 4)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9sh-kTTaNM" title="bloody stream" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>(^ skip to 17:09)</p>

<p>now HERE’S the immortal lupin iii theme <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" /> yet again, my top pick stands out by being the only(? now i’m second guessing myself) version in swing, an impeccable choice that makes this classic tune even catchier! why don’t they utilize it more???</p>

<p>fun and retro with cartoony antics! and of course i’m biased toward part 2.</p>

<h2 id="8-sono-chi-no-sadame-jjba-part-1-op-1">#8: sono chi no sadame (jjba part 1 op 1)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZKAQzGYYSo" title="sono chi no sadame" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>it took the entire duration of my time as a jojo fan to realize, but if i wasn’t a dedicated bloody stream fan, this would be my favorite jojo op!</p>

<p>literally everything about it is insane, the gravitas is off the charts. from the very first shot counting down jojos 6 to 1, this is THE story that started it all. the visuals reference (spoil?) nearly the entire plot of phantom blood, which makes it satisfying to reminisce on. again in hindsight, knowing how many decades it took for a true anime adaptation, and how sono chi no sadame perfected the fantastically fluid and cinematic ink-hatched 3d-animated ops that became iconic to jjba on it’s very first try… THAT’S a debut! and of course, tommy putting everything he has into the world’s longest and most powerful JO!!!</p>

<h2 id="9-homework-ga-owaranai-yu-yu-hakusho-ed-1">#9: homework ga owaranai (yu yu hakusho ed 1)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-KFEnX4LWk" title="homework ga owaranai" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>considering i just started watching yyh with my friends, this becoming an instant favorite is the dark horse of my list LOL!</p>

<p>it’s a banger song and gets tons of mileage out of the parts with relatively minimal visuals – the monochrome, architecture crisscrossed stills of kurama and hiei are my favorite… moody, stylish, and totally classy. a different flavor of retro than lupin!</p>

<h2 id="10-1-mp100-s3-op-1">#10: 1 (mp100 s3 op 1)</h2>

<div class="iframecontainer">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umqzznKblJ0" title="1" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
</div>

<p>it was extremely hard to choose between the 3 mp100 openings… but in the end, this one’s just pure hype! mob choir delivering as always, shots packed gratuitously full of color and movement, all the callbacks to previous seasons… it really feels like bones giving their all for a loveletter sendoff to the world’s best series!!!</p>

<p>WATCH MOB!!!</p>
