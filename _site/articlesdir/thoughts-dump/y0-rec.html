<ul>
  <li>YAKUZA 0 AUUGUJKDJFGUGUGFGFJ
    <ul>
      <li>quality georg: the average yakuza game’s writing is quite bad, yakuza 0 is an outlier and should not be counted</li>
      <li>has my “masterpiece” seal of approval</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-start-here">why start here?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>y0 is the prequel to the first game yakuza 1/yakuza kiwami 1
    <ul>
      <li>no prior knowledge required</li>
      <li>modern (2015)</li>
      <li>one of the best entries the series has to offer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="linear-story-in-an-open-world">linear story in an open world</h2>

<p>SO HERE’S THE DEAL: these structures seem like opposites, but the rgg formula combines them well – i’d say they even cover each other’s weaknesses.</p>

<p>rgg is an rpg with a strictly linear story (no alternate endings, divided into chapters, even), so unlike some open-worlds/sandboxes etc. you’re never left hanging without a job or sense of direction.</p>

<p>but whereas some linear rpg’s can feel restrictive, rgg encourages you to ignore the plot, drop any task at any time to enjoy the open-world city at your own leisure – play minigames, eat at a cafe, pursue wacky substories, etc.</p>

<p>regarding maps, games are usually set in one city district, which is tiny compared to worlds like breath of the wild. but considering their density and detail, they’ve never felt small to me.</p>

<p>(oh and y0 doesn’t have a pin-drop navigation function like y7, but the minimap and map menu work well 👍)</p>

<h2 id="some-possible-warnings">some possible warnings</h2>

<p>well, it’s a beat-em-up crime drama set in a red light district (shrug)</p>

<p>y0’s 1980’s bubble economy setting emphasizes the nightlife/party/cabaret vibe even more than usual, so there are plenty of drunks/creeps groping and harassing women etc.</p>

<p>i’ve also heard people say y0 is one of the most violent entries, which i can see. i find the “heat actions” comically/cartoonishly extreme, but there are more severe parts like torture cutscenes.</p>
