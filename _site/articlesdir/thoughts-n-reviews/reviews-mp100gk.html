  <li>web manga / anime debut: 2012 / 2016</li>
</ul>

<p>IT‚ÄôS SO GOOD. if you ask for my favorite anime, the answer is mob. it‚Äôs the masterpiece i never talk or draw about because my brain Only latches onto bad shows <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" /></p>

<p>if opm uses ‚Äúoverpowered main character subversion‚Äù for comedy, mp100 uses it for drama.</p>

<p>what stood out most to me was how painfully genuine mobbert and friends‚Äô troubles and flaws felt, in how specific, grounded, and relatable they were.</p>

<p>pair ONE‚Äôs excellent writing with perhaps the most stylish, weighty, and impactful animation i‚Äôve seen<sup><a id="foottop1" href="#footbottom1">1</a></sup>, and i can‚Äôt imagine mob dropping from my #1 spot any time soon!</p>

<p>(also, i think reigen lives up to his infamy, memes and all, which is saying a lot <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" />)</p>

<p>i JUST spedran the anime + manga in the year 2024 and was hooked!</p>

<p>one thing about me is that i love information <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" />üëç so i had a great time, as gk regularly dives into explaining all sorts of topics: hunting, tracking, food preparation, wilderness survival, historical technologies, ainu culture and mythology, etc.<sup><a id="foottop2" href="#footbottom2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>gk has a sense of logic and realism i find very appealing. natural hazards Can and Will kill you. the fights are strategic and succinct! ogata‚Äôs especially were (<a href="https://youtu.be/39mw_f3NK9E?t=150">kido y4 engdub voice</a>) SO COOL, and the gun strats were awesome (ex: toni and ogata identifying guns / owners by their sound, people dissembling / disabling each others‚Äô rifles mid-fight).</p>

<p>the army setting means most characters have history / beef with, or at least know of each other from the start (efficient!), and the way connected players and events were revealed bit by bit was satisfying.</p>

<p>this show is unhinged <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" /> both the series as a whole (why are these men always naked <img src="/assets/images/emojis/enid.png" class="emoji" alt="enid emoji" title="enid emoji" />) and the characters themselves my god!!! i have a high bizarreness threshold and i was truly impressed!<sup><a id="foottop3" href="#footbottom3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>anyway, asirpa is so awesome YAY<sup><a id="foottop4" href="#footbottom4">4</a></sup>, i love her dynamic with sugimoto. i‚Äôm also a massive fan of everyone‚Äôs funky eye / eyebrow shapes :^D</p>

      <li><sup><a id="footbottom1" href="#foottop1">1</a></sup> not just during flashy fights, but the expressive posing and little movements ‚Äì that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs at!!! <img src="/assets/images/emojis/evil.png" class="emoji" alt="evil emoji" title="evil emoji" /> the quality of movement OUGH‚Ä¶ i could go on forever‚Ä¶ but i musn‚Äôt!</li>

    <ul>
      <li><sup><a id="footbottom2" href="#foottop2">2</a></sup> a ‚Äúgorey cooking anime‚Äù alongside dorohedoro, though this feels more like a ‚Äúgorey encyclopedia anime‚Äù <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" /></li>
      <li><sup><a id="footbottom3" href="#foottop3">3</a></sup> the jojo / yakuza fan overlap makes sense ‚Äì if you enjoy large, insane, often murderous men, this is the show for you! <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" /></li>
      <li><sup><a id="footbottom4" href="#foottop4">4</a></sup> one of my peeves is when the kid/girl protag is annoying (LOL) or just a pawn / valuable object everyone else controls‚Ä¶ and asirpa is none of that üôè she‚Äôs silly and smart with her own motivations, and people take her seriously!</li>
