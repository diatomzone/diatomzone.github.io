    <p>EPIPHANIES are small-scale, highly specific, and relatively impractical supernatural abilities in EPIPHANY OF ORB.</p>

<h3 id="supernatural-energy">supernatural energy</h3>

<p>(name tbd) this mysterious energy saturates the planet, just like water or air.</p>

<p>when a large amount of energy gathers in one place, reality distorts, allowing the laws of physics to be broken – objects can transform into spheres, steel can be cut like butter, etc…</p>

<p>the ripples of distorted reality can be sensed by nearby epiphany users, monsters, and certain technologies – so watch out!</p>

<h3 id="monsters">monsters</h3>

<p>(name tbd) beings made of supernatural energy. the more energy they contain the greater their influence over reality, and the stronger their abilities become.</p>

<p>to grow, they can passively absorb from their environment or consume other sources of energy, including epiphany users and each other.</p>

<p>sufficient damage will destabilize a monster’s form, destroying it and releasing its energy back into the world.</p>

<h2 id="epiphany-mechanics">epiphany mechanics</h2>

<h3 id="gaining-epiphanies">gaining epiphanies</h3>

<p>an epiphany is triggered by a pivotal character development, usually a conscious change in worldview. the resulting ability is (symbolically or vaguely) related to the user’s change.</p>

<p>the revelation changes something in the user’s brain, allowing them to generate supernatural energy.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-so-far">the story so far</h2>

<p>in-universe, epiphanies and the wider supernatural world are not common knowledge, so little is known about their origin, variety, limitations, etc.</p>

<p>unfortunately, those with the ambition and means to research these things tend to intend to harness them for evil. zug’s boss is one example.</p>

<p>there is no known way to intentionally gain an epiphany.</p>

<p>SPOILERS: <span class="spoilered">but stealing one, something so deeply entwined in a person’s being…? if you could figure out how to steal the entirety of a person’s memory and lived experiences it might work, but the consequences would be exceptional.</span></p>

<h2 id="trivia">trivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li>one of my nitpicks is when superpowers and inciting incidents feel impersonalized, random, or predestined, like the character has no agency. so i’m very happy with how the pieces of this power system fell into place!</li>
