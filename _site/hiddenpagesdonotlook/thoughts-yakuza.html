            <p>OUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGUUUGHHGGHHH</p>

<h2 id="whats-it">what’s it?</h2>

<p>“half beat-em-up crime drama thriller, half everything BUT that” – me</p>

<p>an ongoing brawler/open world rpg series about the legendary yakuza kiryu’s life in (and out of) organized crime!<sup><a id="foottop1" href="#footbottom1">1</a></sup></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="gameplay-log">gameplay log</h2>

<ul>
  <li>i have played y0, yk1, yk2, y3 and am still playing y4! no spoilers please 😌</li>
  <li>y0 was my introduction to the series<sup><a id="foottop2" href="#footbottom2">2</a></sup> and is still my favorite entry! it’s the only one i’d give my “masterpiece” seal of approval so far, mainplot-wise <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" /></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="game-series-evolution">game series evolution</h2>

<p>rgg is the first real series i’ve gotten into – i had only played games that came in ones or twos<sup><a id="foottop3" href="#footbottom3">3</a></sup>, so getting to see how the gameplay, writing, and overall production has changed over the course of a relatively long-running series (with a continuous story no less!) has been super intriguing to me! what works what doesn’t and why? 🤔 game design is so cool!!!</p>

<h3 id="exp-and-upgrades">exp and upgrades</h3>

<p>even if kiryu learns and forgets his strongest moves like 4 games in a row LMAO, the exp/upgrade system has changed every game i’ve played so far which is super interesting!!</p>

<ul>
  <li>y0
    <ul>
      <li>a feature unique to y0 is buying upgrades with money instead of exp!<sup><a id="foottop4" href="#footbottom4">4</a></sup> on my first playthrough i finished the story with only half of the moves/stats/etc. unlocked because i spent all my money on real estate <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" /> and for certainly unrelated reasons, i died in y0 exponentially more than any other entry <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>yk1
    <ul>
      <li>brings back the “skill tree” format from y0, except the tree categories are different and you buy with exp as per usual! on one hand i liked not splitting my funds between upgrades and business and was able to unlock everything by endgame, but the fact that 1) you run out of things to spend on and end up sitting with maxed-out 9999 exp could easily be solved with bonus health/heat/etc. unlockables which they had in the previously released game y0…? and 2) the dragon style is strangely organized (the majima everywhere system unlocks things out of order?) and virtually useless until maxed out 🤔 both of these feel like big and easily-amendable oversights!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>yk2
    <ul>
      <li>this time the unlockables are in catalog format, meaning you aren’t limited by skill tree progress – buy health 10 times in a row if you’d like! also, the exp is divided into separate categories (strength, speed, intelligence etc.) which i found convenient (it’s also fun to see what foods make you smart HAHA)!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>y3
    <ul>
      <li>very strange system, not sure if this was carried over from the original y1/y2 games.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>y4
    <ul>
      <li>much faster progression compared to previous games due to your time/efforts being split between 4 separate protags – both factors i enjoyed! the “soul orb” currency for upgrading abilities is new but works pretty standard i think! also, health and heat are not upgrades, but gained automatically upon level-up.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>CONCLUSION: as someone who can’t be bothered to grind for exp, i prefer setups that let me max out my upgrades by the time i reach the finale.</p>

<h3 id="game-polish">game polish</h3>

<p>jumping from yk2 (2017, super fancy, newest? engine) to y3 (2009, remastered ps3 game) was a big blast to the past! surprisingly though, i felt the smaller, more subtle details dated y3 WAY more than the visuals!</p>

<ul>
  <li>slower, longer street fight intros</li>
  <li>idk if it was just my computer but the footstep noise was super loud and the ___ was super quiet – a very jarring combination</li>
  <li>lack of “quality of life” features from the newer games, ex: you can only buy one item per restaurant visit, rendering completion a distant dream</li>
</ul>

<p>CONCLUSION: the little things make all the difference! thank you to the past decades of games that helped us reach the current levels of convenience</p>

<h3 id="money-is-important">money is important</h3>

<p>i personally need copious amounts of money to get things done in these games which is why the business minigames are so awesome HEHEHE</p>

<p>in yk1 i was so broke, even stocking up on healing items drained my funds… no way i could afford cabaret clubs, cool weapons, or anything like that! 😔</p>

<h3 id="karaoke">karaoke</h3>

<p>yakuza is a rhythm game with a very long yakuza sidestory!!!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="thee-range-now-in-your-hands">THEE RANGE: now in your hands!</h2>

<p>one of my all-time favorite things is when a work has “the range” and yakuza is a perfect example – balancing over-the-top violence and despair-inducing plots with</p>

<p>yakuza is a “serious” game also known for its comically absurd “substories” and unnecessarily wide minigame selection.</p>

<p>what’s super interesting is that the game is NOT responsible for maintaining this delicate balance. there are no scripted goofs to lighten the mood between heavy scenes, like there would be in a movie – the main plots are dead serious. instead, the player takes control!</p>

<p>and as such, the player gets exactly what they want – when you need intrigue you can follow the story, and when you need nonsense, it’s right there waiting for you!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="its-so-funny-even-when-its-not-supposed-to-be">it’s so funny even when it’s not supposed to be</h2>

<p>help</p>

<h2 id="things-i-find-to-be-unintentionally-hilarious">things i find to be unintentionally hilarious</h2>

<ul>
  <li>to me, there’s nothing funnier and more impressive than unnecessarily high-effort spent on minor details – a game that basically recreated an entire city block and packed it with 948504 neon signs and minigames and catchable rotatable 3d fish and real-life restaurants with photos of the foods for the selection screen is as good as it gets, really <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" />
    <ul>
      <li>and of course, infamous moments like rgg inventing bread physics so ichiban can eat a piece of bread HRGH</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>i made more money from a single fight in y0 than i had in like the entirety of like yk1 😭😭</li>
  <li>
    <p>in y0, you make so much money right off the bat that amenities – taxis, minigames, restaurants, and unlimited amounts of healing items – are virtually free :^)</p>
  </li>
  <li>in y4 akiyama is the only one who can learn like 3 extra taunts because he’s good at being annoying <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysis">analysis</h2>

<p>this series lets you live out your wildest fantasies such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a powerful enough wallet and stomach to buy and eat every dish in a restaurant in one go</li>
  <li>winning crane game plushies</li>
  <li>beating people to death with daikon nunchucks</li>
  <li>recycling</li>
  <li>not being responsible for over 10 billion dollars in property damage</li>
  <li>listening to the bartender’s detailed explanation of your drink’s crafting process, flavor profile, and reputation among aficionados every time you buy a drink</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="analysis-real">analysis (real)</h2>

<p>there is so much happening in these games and so much games. to the point where i can barely remember some of the plots because there were two dozen people involved and they’re all died. it’s analysis central i don’t even know what to say!!! my personal liveblog/notetaking/analysis google doc is 78 pages of bullet points as of apr 2023… so it will not be pasted here <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" /></p>

<h2 id="true-facts">true facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>i think they should make a yakuza sports game where everyone plays sports and this is extremely important to me because it would be hilarious
    <ul>
      <li>perhaps it could even be a crossover like mario and sonic at the olympics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>i also think they should make a rhythm game in the style of the final fantasy “theatrythm” game which i played the demo of on switch… the simple either-button-or-joystick input scheme and AAA rhythmgame sound design makes everything SO satisfying and the unit/party style “battles” would suit our brawler cast perfectly!!!! there is so much awesome rgg music it deserves a spotlight!! also instead of the blob artstyle they should use the <a href="https://tarokro.tumblr.com/post/707978474911039488/official-yakuza-x-pop-team-epic-collaboration-kuji">pop team epic collab designs</a> or even the indescribable <a href="https://tarokro.tumblr.com/post/660335598714896385/ryu-ga-gotoku-of-the-end-x-777-townnet-mobile">dead souls collab “chibis”</a> because i love images that are bad for people’s health
    <ul>
      <li>speaking of sound design yk2’s chiming karaoke “hit” sound is way too loud and long to be a hit sound!!!!!!!!!!! can’t believe they did that get outta town!! on the other hand i AM a fan of the 4-lane 1-speed note style in yk2 🤔 a much more standard format but it’s standard cus it works! plus more spacing gives you a chance at more complicated maps, i’d be bad at it but a third higher difficulty level would be awesome :^o</li>
      <li>you know what i hear there’s dancing later on maybe it should be idol/band themed instead. kashiwagi on the keys</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li><sup><a id="footbottom1" href="#foottop1">1</a></sup> apparently ichiban takes over as protag in the turn-based 7th game, but i haven’t gotten there yet</li>
  <li><sup><a id="footbottom2" href="#foottop2">2</a></sup> coincidentally, i started playing after an extremely coincidental recommendation. if that hadn’t happened… <img src="/assets/images/emojis/shannon.png" class="emoji" alt="shannon emoji" title="shannon emoji" /> much to think about!</li>
  <li><sup><a id="footbottom3" href="#foottop3">3</a></sup> also counting same-game type deals like the smash bros series</li>
  <li><sup><a id="footbottom4" href="#foottop4">4</a></sup> “investing in yourself”?? i know i’m not the only one who has decided these guys are eating dollar bills LKJGDLKFJD</li>
