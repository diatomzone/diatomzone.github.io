            <h1>about coding</h1>
            <p>i have always wanted to make a website but my brain is too small for coding.</p>

<p>instead of getting smarter, i simply tried again and again. this is my third attempt at using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, a static site builder!</p>

<p>my goal is to work smarter not harder, which is hard to do when your brain is so small, but i’m getting there!</p>

<p>my priority is to do the least work possible. i will explode into ten thousand million miserable meat chunks before i manually code every link and link description in my listing pages. so i’ve built my own shortcut with a listing “includes”, using YAML data, liquid variables, “includes”, and for loops!</p>

<p>instead of hard-coding every link and description on my listing pages and exploding into a million miserable meat chunks, i’ve built</p>

<p>laziness inspires effort and innovation!</p>

<p>i am using YAML data, liquid variables, includes, and for loops at every opportunity. like jekyll, these things take much longer to figure out but make everything so much easier in the long run!</p>

<p>site builders don’t let me do what i want. now i can standardize the top margin of every element, get rid of the insane gap beneath every image, and finally live in peace with my immaculate spacing! i even set up a wiki!</p>

<p>everything is so difficult, yet when i see something i’ve made from scratch, the world is beautiful.</p>
