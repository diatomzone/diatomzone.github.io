<p>i genuinely think jjba changed my brain chemistry, as i had never obsessed over anything with such overwhelming severity before <img src="/assets/images/emojis/reigen.png" class="emoji" alt="reigen emoji" title="reigen emoji" /></p>

<p>if i had to pin down one main appeal, it would be The Flavor. coming from a sea of same-y shows and battle shonens, i was blown away – jjba is an explosion of araki’s unabashed love for flamboyant fashion, western pop culture and 70’s-80’s music, random wikipedia articles, and apparently, writing dialogue that does not sound like any human alive. literally king of doing whatever he wants!</p>

<p>joe’s wackiness is not just on a superficial or aesthetic level, however. the series is a mishmash of inconsistency – a walking contradiction<sup><a id="foottop1" href="#footbottom1">1</a></sup>, if you will!</p>

<p>the plots stick to simple goals while also ignoring basic logic and storytelling conventions.</p>

<p>jojo has some of the worst and best story endings i’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>can be so bad and confusing i forget what happened immediately after reading, or one of my favorite endings of any anime that makes me <img src="/assets/images/emojis/shannon.png" class="emoji" alt="shannon emoji" title="shannon emoji" /> <img src="/assets/images/emojis/ungalo.png" class="emoji" alt="ungalo emoji" title="ungalo emoji" /> when i think about it HA</p>

<p>certain moments and characters are filled with brilliant thematic meaning and moments of poetic cinema that were almost certainly unintentional on araki’s part.</p>
