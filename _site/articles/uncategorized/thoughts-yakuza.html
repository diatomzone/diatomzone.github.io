<p>“half beat-em-up thiller crime drama, half everything BUT that”</p>

<p>this series lets you live out your wildest fantasies such as: buying and eating every dish in the restaurant in one go and winning copious amounts of crane game plushies.</p>

<h2 id="whats-it">what’s it?</h2>

<p>an ongoing 15+ year-old brawler/open world rpg series about the legendary kiryu’s life in (and out of) the yakuza!</p>

<p>(ichiban takes over as protag in the 7th game, but i haven’t gotten there yet)</p>

<ul>
  <li>i have played y0, yk1, yk2, y3 and am still playing y4! no spoilers please 😌</li>
  <li>y0 was my introduction to the series<sup>1</sup> and is my current favorite entry!! it’s the only one i’d give my “masterpiece” seal of approval so far <img src="/assets/images/emojis/zenigata.png" class="emoji" alt="zenigata emoji" title="zenigata emoji" /></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="true-facts">true facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>i think they should make a yakuza sports game where everyone plays sports and this is extremely important to me because it would be hilarious</li>
  <li>i also think they should make a rhythm game in the style of the final fantasy “theatrythm” game which i played the demo of… the simple either-button-or-joystick input scheme and AAA rhythmgame sound design makes it SO satisfying and the unit/party style “battles” would suit our brawler cast perfectly!!!! there is so much awesome rgg music it deserves a spotlight!!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysis">analysis</h2>

<h3 id="karaoke">karaoke</h3>

<ul>
  <li>yk2’s chiming “hit” sound is way too loud and long to be a hit sound!!!!!!!!!!! get outta town! besides that i AM a fan of the 4-lane 1-speed note style in yk2 😌 a much more standard format but it’s standard cus it works!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li><sup>1</sup> coincidentally, i started playing after an extremely coincidental recommendation. if that hadn’t happened… <img src="/assets/images/emojis/shannon.png" class="emoji" alt="shannon emoji" title="shannon emoji" /> much to think about!</li>
