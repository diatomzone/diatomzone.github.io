## this site

welcome to my first website that actually works! i'm still experimenting with the setup, so stuff might move around.

i'll be using this place to consolidate all sorts of things including information about my ocs, computer-related projects like twine games and sitebuilding notes, important images, and maybe even some art!

## websites

the things people create for fun have always amazed me more than i can say. the effort and joy of making something for yourself -- it's really beautiful.

i wish i was more articulate, but if you're here reading this, i'm sure you understand :^)
