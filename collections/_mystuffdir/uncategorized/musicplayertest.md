title: javascript music player test
---

i've been wanting to add a persistent music player to this site, but everything's still in progress... here's what i have so far!

the playlist is set, but the only custom control that works is play/pause LOL

<div class="iframecontainer"><iframe src="/musicplayerpage.html" title="music player page window"></iframe></div>

[(mobile fullscreen button)](/musicplayerpage.html)
