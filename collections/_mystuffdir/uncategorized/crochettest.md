attempts at longhand/shorthand toggles that may as well live here!

## web version

<div class="iframecontainer"><iframe src="/assets/twine/crochettest-html.html" title="crochet test window"></iframe></div>

[(experimental: mobile fullscreen button)](/assets/twine/crochettest-html.html)

## twine version

<div class="iframecontainer"><iframe src="/assets/twine/crochettest-twine.html" title="crochet test window"></iframe></div>

[(experimental: mobile fullscreen button)](/assets/twine/crochettest-twine.html)

i hoped the twine version would be easier for non-coders to edit but it's actually more annoying... i don't like the "update" button...
