## synopsis

a kingdom in the throes of civil war -- a corrupt king who rules through fear, and the downtrodden revolutionaries who seek to overthrow him.

it's up to the strongest knight in the land to change everyone's lives... by making things even worse.

when asked why she serves the evil king, rosenwall simply shrugs.

nobody is having a good time!

## setting

it's a generic medieval-type fantasy land.

mages can do magic, but there aren't really any magical creatures (or at least they're not the focus).

### the (unnamed) kingdom

this place sucks... there's always mortal peril...

### the king's castle

the castle the titular castle guard guards.

this grand fortress sit atop a hill{{site.data.foot.t1}} in the center of the capital city, and it is under siege in the animatic because everyone wants to kill the king üëç

beneath the castle lies the sprawling dungeon that imprisons hundreds of citizens, including pasquale's family.

- {{site.data.foot.b1}} almost, perhaps, like the house that john built{{site.data.foot.t2}}
  - {{site.data.foot.b2}} this is a reference to the oft-meme'd song "burning men's soul (in the house like carpet)", which can be found in the [brain radio archive](/brainradio.html)
