ROSENWALL is a main character in CASTLE GUARD.

she is a knight who "leads" the king's royal guard (does zero leading and doesn't know any of their names).

terrorizes enemies and allies{{site.data.foot.t1}} alike with her unpredictability, penchant for mindless cruelty, and overwhelming combat prowess.

generally does her job by eliminating threats to the castle, but she's just wandering around doing whatever she wants.

no personality, morals, or discernable motives.

## relationships

- king: guy in charge.
- pasquale: new guy.
- aldus: buddy.
- marion: fun to fight.

## history

even i don't know why she started working for the king {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}} she probably killed a quarter of his troops for fun so he offered her money and she said ok...

besides the obvious "we are on opposite sides of the civil war" scenario, marion seems to have a personal grudge against rosenwall. what past do they share...? ðŸ¤”

## abilities

extremely overpowered, cannot be killed by currently known methods.

## trivia

- her hair bun is fancily styled, perhaps a bundled-up braid vaguely resembling a rose
- was once approached by an assassin who asked her to poison the king. she said ok and poured the assassin's vial of poison into the castle's main well. everyone had stomach problems for a week, including rosenwall.
- probably my most straight-up evil oc. women's wrongs <3

- {{site.data.foot.b1}} she does not distinguish between the king's enemies and the king's allies
