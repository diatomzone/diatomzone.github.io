## relationships

- king: hates for obvious reasons. wants to defeat him to save his family, but can't do it alone.
- rosenwall: works under her as part of the royal guard. basically the only person who isn't terrified of and/or trying to kill her, so he follows her around.
- aldus: often works with them. weirded out by the fact that aldus initiates normal, casual conversations.

## history

pasquale was a simple country lad until his village got burned down by the king and his forces, supposedly to crush dissidents.

he caught the king's eye by putting up a fight. after refusing the king's offer to join the royal guard, his family was taken hostage and he was forced to comply.

## abilities

just a kid who tries hard...
