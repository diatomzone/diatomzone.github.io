ALDUS is a supporting character in CASTLE GUARD.

they are a mercenary archer who serves the highest bidder -- currently the king.

a legendary crackshot whose signature is shooting people through the eye... after shooting out each of their limbs.

their sadistic style is jarringly contrasted by their amicable air off the battlefield.

## relationships

- king: has the deepest pockets of them all.
- rosenwall: they actually get along very well! perhaps it's their similarity.
- pasquale: poor kid, he'll lose hope sooner or later.
- marion: has been told to keep an eye out for her.

## history

has been scooting from place to place, even switching sides in the middle of a fight to secure the highest pay.

the king's castle provides a bit of shelter from the exorbitant number of enemies they've made this way.

## abilities

unrivaled with their powerful longbow.

it's based on an english longbow, which puts it around 6 feet long, with a draw weight of 100-150 lbs.

stays up and away to avoid close combat.

## trivia

- still has both eyes, just likes wearing an eyepatch while shooting
- ambidextrous
- wears a gambeson (quilted cloth jacket) (it's a type of armor)
