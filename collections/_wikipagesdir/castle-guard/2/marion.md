MARION is a main character in CASTLE GUARD.

she is a mage who is one of the four leaders spearheading the revolution.

no-nonsense, trying to kill the king.

## history

born and raised under the king's reign of terror, her (concealed) rage is personal.

has a complicated(?) one-sided antagonistic relationship with rosenwall (rosenwall doesn't care)

rosenwall doesn't seem to

besides the obvious "we are on opposite sides of the civil war" scenario, marion seems to have a personal grudge against rosenwall. what past do they share...? ðŸ¤”

## abilities

highly skilled with telekinesis and fire magic.

the rosenwall vs. marion animatic is like one of the earlymiddle fights -- since rosenwall is virtually invincible, marion will be gamebreaking {{site.data.emojis.evil}}

## trivia

- her cloak is purple, which was perhaps unintentionally based on those assassin guys from ranger's apprentice {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}
