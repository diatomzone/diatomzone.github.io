MARION is a main character in CASTLE GUARD.

she is a mage who is one of the four leaders spearheading the revolution.

a no-nonsense lone wolf who serves as the rebels' top assassin (duelist?).

wants to kill the king, but rosenwall stands in her way.

## relationships

- king: wants to kill him, his entire court, etc.
- rosenwall: complicated(?) one-sided antagonism on marion's part{{site.data.foot.t1}}.
- aldus: knows of them. they've fought in the same battles, but haven't met directly.

## history

raised during the king's reign of terror and a witness to the people's suffering, marion's (concealed) rage is personal.

got involved with the revolutionaries at some point and climbed the ranks.

## abilities

highly skilled with telekinesis and fire magic.

strategic, uses misdirection and the environment to her advantage.

her strong yet focused offense is less effective against large crowds.

the rosenwall vs. marion animatic is like one of the earlymiddle fights -- since rosenwall is virtually indestructible, marion will have to break physics to truly take her on {{site.data.emojis.evil}}

## trivia

- her cloak is purple, which was perhaps unintentionally based on those assassin guys from ranger's apprentice {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}
  - feels like that series inspired several things...
- it's standard practice for good-quality armor, weapons, etc. to be warded against magic (such as telekinesis), lest mages kill owners with their own equipment

- {{site.data.foot.b1}} rosenwall doesn't care, or perhaps doesn't remember why marion hates her ðŸ¤” or both!
