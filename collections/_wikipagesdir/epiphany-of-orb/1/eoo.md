## synopsis

uranium university, 20XX.

bill boatswain was an ordinary student -- pastashapeography major by day and sleeping pastashapeography major by night -- until a rooftop epiphany granted them the power to shape anything they touch into a sphere.

bill quickly learns new quark city is a place where supernatural forces hide in plain sight, their newfound ability making them a target for magic-hungry monsters and scheming villains alike.

alongside “magical girl” century blue and wandering enigma fiori ironheart, our three friends must evade the nefarious henchman zug archaeopteryx, navigate university life, and uncover the nature of their reality-bending "epiphanies".

## setting

### new quark city

a fictional near-future new york city. there are flying bikes and scooters (but no flying cars due to physics limitations).

### uranium university

the school bill and friends attend. neither prestigous nor unprestigious, but actually quite prestigious if you're a pastashapeographer.

the campus and its bustling college town are located on the edge of new quark city, near the specific ocean (the aquatic ocean is on the west coast).

## trivia

- this started with me trying to combine as many overused tropes and nonsensical ideas as possible, then it accidentally became compelling
  - like putting down agar for cultures to grow on
- out of all my ocs, this main cast has the most characterization by far (meaning, more than none)
- i did not know "savior of song" had been used as an anime op when i chose it, no wonder it fit the 1:30min format so well...
