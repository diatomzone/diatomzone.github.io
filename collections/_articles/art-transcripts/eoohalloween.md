[image description: a two-page comic of characters talking in an apartment. century is a girl with shaved hair wearing a tank top. bill is a person with short hair wearing a hairband and t-shirt. zug is a person with long hair wearing a button-up shirt.

century sits at a table reading a book as bill turns the page of a wall calendar. bill muses, "seems it's finally october..."

a window rattles open and zug climbs through shouting, "WOAH!! you know what that means!" bill whips around in alarm -- "zugzwang archaeopteryx what are you doing in my apartment"

zug puts century and bill in headlocks, grinning. "what are you two gonna dress up as for HALLOWEEN??" "OH i already know!" century smiles.

"i want to be sailor moon again! my magical girl idol!" century beams, hands pressed together. an imagine-spot century poses in costume. bill gives a thumbs up. "great choice!"

zug poses. "well I'M going to be wug from linguistics!" "from linguistics? bill asks. "from linguistics?" century asks. "from linguistics," zug confirms. an imagine-spot zug cackles while wearing a wug-shaped hat. wugs are imaginary creatures resembling small birds.

"get it? cus it sounds like my name!" zug explains, arms raised. century says, "i guess i understand!" while bill says "i don't." a diagram points from "zug" to "wug".

"how about you, bill billy bilgewater?" zug asks, lounging on top of the table and twirling century's coffee mug.

"fiori and i were thinking... we should be remy and linguini from ratatoullie, but in reverse," bill says.

zug and century sit in silence. the mug is on the ground. "OK so like," bill starts.

"linguini rides on remy's head and teaches him how to be a rat?" bill gestures to their head. an imagine-spot bill, dressed as a chef, sits on fiori's shoulders. fiori wears round glasses and a rat onesie with the hood up.

"hmmmmmmm," zug grimaces. century looks conflicted.

"zug, if you're jealous, you could be remy too!" bill offers with a smile. "THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE HERE," zug interjects, hunched over the table. in an imagine spot, rat onesie fiori carries chef costume bill who carries rat onesie zug. back on scene, century, walking away with her book and dripping coffee mug, cheerfully comments "now i'm excited to see what everyone else is going to be!"

"shaved ice would definitely pick something 'cool'..." century grins, making an "ok" sign with her hand. "heh good one!" bill replies. an imagine-spot shaved ice, a bald secret agent, poses with a smoking handgun.

scene change. a figure in a suit walks into a store, its partially-obscured sign reading "...t halloween".

inside, shaved ice happily appraises a crinkled package.

it reads "ICE PRINCESS COSTUME" and features the likeness of a certain copyrighted disney character. "cool," shaved ice says.
