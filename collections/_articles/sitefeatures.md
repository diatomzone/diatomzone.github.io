i am extremely particular about my webpage preferences.

## zestiest features

- when resizing the browser, page content will not shrink until margins disappear
- no extra space at top or bottom of containers -- elements run flush with padding

## functional features

- responsive layout: elements resize and reorder on narrow browsers/mobile
- additional navigation at bottom of page
- hidden "skip to content" button for keyboard users/screen readers (press TAB then ENTER)
- larger font size and dark background because my eyeballs

## bonus features

- image alt text hovertext
- iframes (ex: youtube embeds) maintain 16:9 aspect ratio
- "discord emojis" stored as global variables, called with {%raw%}`{{site.emojis.emojiname}}`{%endraw%}
- no javascript (yet)
- lightweight: external videos, no large image files, etc.
- custom cursor and handwritten font
