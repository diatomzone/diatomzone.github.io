## my god

my favorite absolutely terrible show that i would not recommend to anyone!!!!!!

## analysis

i hear it's like scooby doo if it was bad

also my friends and i have agreed the best lupin movie is dreamworks' "the bad guys"!<sup>1</sup> thank you the bad guys! {{site.data.emojis.loveimages}}

## THE sandbox anime of all time

i forgot who called lupin a sandbox anime/build-a-bear series but that's exactly what appeals to me!!

against all odds, the long-running, continuity-less structure packed with wildly different tones and conflicting characterizations actually works in the series' favor!

1) it makes the series and characters feel complex and timeless -- while each member of lupingang might have 1-3 character traits per work LMAO, multiply that by 2309483 versions of themselves... from wacky cartoon slapstick to whatever was going on in twcfm, they've done it all in every decade, THEY HAVE THE RANGE!! i love the sense that everything could change, yet the core cast would still be the most important part of each other's lives in every continuity... literally the blorbesties of all time OUGH

2) with so much material and zero canon, you're free to build the most compelling version of the series and characters with whatever appeals most to you!<sup>2</sup> {{site.data.emojis.evil}} i personally enjoy tumbling the characters in a washer of goofs 'n gags while extrapolating their extremely human and tragic existences for an underlying "depth of flavor" ðŸ˜Œ cooking hacks!

## music!!!

the ost is so important i love it so much thank you yuji ohno and bands for my life!!! also it's one of the very few objectively good things about lupin HRGH<sup>3</sup>

without such a fun stylish bangin' and iconic musical identity poopin the turd would be nothing!!! hunter x hunter's "departure" is so excellent they used it for 147 episodes straight but who else has been rearranging the same lupin theme for like. uhhh from part 2 to part 6 that's 1977-2022 so 45 YEARS OF TV AND FILM LDKJGLERKJGGLKJFG {{site.data.emojis.reigen}} {{site.data.emojis.reigen}} ([here's](https://completely-legit.tumblr.com/post/650235599173926912) a non-comprehensive but very cool lupin iii theme comp!)

anyways my favorite version is the '80 version (it's in swing!) so here's an [awesome live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyl7fgvV1oo) and a version with [a ton of fun vibraphone solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZMitvIHIkI)!! :^)

while the core of the ost is timeless jazz, i also love the extreme 80's-ness going on in the sun-drenched brightly-colored pink jacket anime -- the retro feeling is delicious!<sup>4</sup>

## i love classic fiat 500 model f

BEST CHARACTER NOT EVEN JOKING my whole lupingang fiat thesis etc. etc.

least excellent fiat appearances: (let's get these out of the way first)

- blue jacket: disappointing washed-out barely-yellow color especially considering this modern part has plenty of bright colors. fiat crashes and gets replaced by a cop car for like the rest of whichever part. UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!
- part 6: same dull palette. fiat gets shot to smithereens in like the first ep

most excellent fiat appearances:

- the first: BRIGHT yellow fresh glossy paint and that orbiting shot and those SPICYFLAVOR 2d exhaust/tire smoke effects in the opening YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ i watched the carchase trailer 94583 times before the blu-ray came out my god establishing jigen goemon and fiat's abilities SO CONCICELY with unlimited swag, jigen's rearview mirror trickshots and goyamon with the sunroof YES, the way jigen decelerated and passed UNDER the airborne truck to catch goemon, fiat swerving around bashing bigger cars and jumping off the pavement like a cartoon, THE SMUDGES ON THE WINDOWS (and the behind-the-scenes pic with the shoe scuffs on the dashboard...! gotta find that one ðŸ˜­ðŸ’•), lupingang effortlessly outclassing zenigata's entourage, coordination without a single word...!!! ok yeah now that i've typed a whole essay top cinema moments of all time FIAT NATION!!!!!! also later when everyone was clambering around the clown car and goemon let lupin fall off the plane and die LKASJGLKJFGF
- cagliostro: FIAT 500 SHOOTS TO STARDOM!!!! cute travel-packed fiat, fire treasure roadtrip montage, rock-paper-gun tire change intermission, and of course the famous clarisse car chase with souped-up fiat and the lupin '80 theme!! extremely iconic all around!!! always remember backseat goemon suffocating in the money ðŸ˜Œ
- fuma conspiracy: fuma's animation was insanely good and the multiple(!) unnecessarily long and extravagantly chaotic car chases took full advantage of it -- i loved every second!!!! the MOST destruction of public and private property, LEAST regard for the laws of physics, MOST items debris police cars and comical npc interactions/reactions drawn, and shockingly, zero civilians hit! fujiko's motorcycling looked fantastic too (parts of the second chase were literally [animated on 1's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTGPoZzG-PI&t=197s)) and i love how she and the others got to work together against zenigata in that one!!
- occasional blue fiat: baby blue or deep sky blue, it looks perfect!!! especially with the bright palette of part 3!

i also love the mercedes ssk as well :^) cars can be friends!

- <sup>1</sup> lupin is like the dirt that allows beautiful crops to flourish
- <sup>2</sup> plus you can fill in the generous gaps with anything you'd like! so porous {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}
- <sup>3</sup> another: the signature 3 mouth >:^]
- <sup>4</sup> i wish i could watch more cus it got to a point where the subtitle quality was incomprehensible ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
- <sup>5</sup> fun fact: the trailer for the first is what got me into lupin HA, it was the most expressive and flavorful translation of 2d chardesigns to 3d i'd ever seen!!!
