## my god

my favorite absolutely terrible show that i would not recommend to anyone!!!!!!

## analysis

i hear it's like scooby doo if it was bad

also my friends and i have agreed the best lupin movie is dreamworks' "the bad guys"! thank you the bad guys! {{site.data.emojis.loveimages}}

## THE sandbox anime of all time

i forgot who called lupin a sandbox anime/build-a-bear series but that's exactly what makes it appealing to me!!

against all odds, the long-running, continuity-less structure with wildly different tones and conflicting characterizations actually works in the series' favor!

1) it gives the series and characters a sense of timelessness and complexity -- while each member of lupingang might have 1-3 character traits per work LMAO, multiply that by 2309483 versions of themselves... from wacky cartoon slapstick to whatever was going on in twcfm, they've done it all in every decade, THEY HAVE THE RANGE!!!<sup>1</sup>

2) with so much material and zero canon, you're free to build the most compelling version of the series and characters with whatever appeals most to you!<sup>2</sup> {{site.data.emojis.evil}} i personally enjoy tumbling the characters in a washer of goofs 'n gags while extrapolating their extremely human and tragic existences for an underlying "depth of flavor" ðŸ˜Œ cooking hacks!

## music!!!

the ost is so important i love it so much thank you yuji ohno and band for my life!!! also it's one of the very few objectively good things about lupin HRGH

without such a fun stylish bangin' and iconic musical identity poopin the turd would be nothing!!! hunter x hunter's "departure" is so excellent they used it for 147 episodes straight but who else has been rearranging the same lupin theme for like. uhhh from part 2 to part 6 that's 1977-2022 so 45 YEARS OF TV AND FILM LDKJGLERKJGGLKJFG {{site.data.emojis.reigen}} {{site.data.emojis.reigen}} ([here's](https://completely-legit.tumblr.com/post/650235599173926912) a non-comprehensive but very cool lupin iii theme comp!)

anyways my favorite version is the '80 version (it's in swing!) so here's an [awesome live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyl7fgvV1oo) and a version with [a ton of fun vibraphone solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZMitvIHIkI)!! :^)

while the core of the ost is timeless jazz, i also love the extreme 80's-ness going on in the sun-drenched brightly-colored pink jacket anime -- the retro feeling is delicious!<sup>3</sup>

- <sup>1</sup> no matter what else changes, the core cast remains constant... i really love the sense that their bond is so strong, they'll have each other's backs in every continuity... OUGH
- <sup>2</sup> plus you can fill in the generous gaps with anything you'd like! so porous {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}
- <sup>3</sup> i'm still sad i had to drop it halfway cus the subtitle quality was incomprehensible ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
