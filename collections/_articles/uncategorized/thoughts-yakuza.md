title: "thoughts dump: yakuza / like a dragon series"

"half beat-em-up thiller crime drama, half everything BUT that"

this series lets you live out your wildest fantasies such as: buying and eating every dish in the restaurant in one go and winning copious amounts of crane game plushies.

## what's it?

an ongoing 15+ year-old brawler/open world rpg series about the legendary kiryu's life in (and out of) the yakuza!

(ichiban takes over as protag in the 7th game, but i haven't gotten there yet)

## gameplay log

- i have played y0, yk1, yk2, y3 and am still playing y4! no spoilers please ðŸ˜Œ
- y0 was my introduction to the series<sup>1</sup> and is my current favorite entry!! it's the only one i'd give my "masterpiece" seal of approval so far {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}

## true facts

- i think they should make a yakuza sports game where everyone plays sports and this is extremely important to me because it would be hilarious
- i also think they should make a rhythm game in the style of the final fantasy "theatrythm" game which i played the demo of... the simple either-button-or-joystick input scheme and AAA rhythmgame sound design makes it SO satisfying and the unit/party style "battles" would suit our brawler cast perfectly!!!! there is so much awesome rgg music it deserves a spotlight!!

## analysis

### karaoke

- yk2's chiming "hit" sound is way too loud and long to be a hit sound!!!!!!!!!!! get outta town! besides that i AM a fan of the 4-lane 1-speed note style in yk2 ðŸ˜Œ a much more standard format but it's standard cus it works!

- <sup>1</sup> coincidentally, i started playing after an extremely coincidental recommendation. if that hadn't happened... {{site.data.emojis.shannon}} much to think about!
