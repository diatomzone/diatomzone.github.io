citypop!!! a vaguely-defined music genre(?) from 70's/80's japan, it's really more about the vibes i think {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}

here are some of my favorite picks!

## windy summer

<div class="centered" style="max-width:{{page.vidwidth}};">
  <div class="iframecontainer">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4driqASPxqc" title="windy summer by anri" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

when someone asks what citypop's all about, [windy summer by anri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4driqASPxqc) is my go-to example!

it's bright and upbeat, with a boppin' horn section and slappin' bass, some 80's synths/keyboards(?), and the beloved sax solo -- all ingredients for that quintessential citypop flavor! bonus points for the summer mood and "adjective noun" naming convention {{site.data.emojis.reigen}}

(also, for any cat's eye fans, anri did the [original 1983 anime opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-BrT2SQ7SI) as well as the [lupin iii vs. cat's eye 2023 version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF7HoWKdq08)!!)

  </div>
</div>

there are a lot of energetic songs on this list, so here's [summer blue by bread and butter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5IRhlRWtFs) with a warm, laid-back feeling i love!

  </div>
</div>

[watashitachi o shinjite ite by cindy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr-WemEPw48) has no business being such a bop and a groove... a boove if you will...

## heart de furimuite

<div class="centered" style="max-width:{{page.vidwidth}};">
  <div class="iframecontainer">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cAs5Gw3TGXs" title="heart de furimuite by kanako wada" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

sorry for the unofficial vids LOL, but [heart de furimuite by kanako wada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAs5Gw3TGXs) was on my brain radio list as 1 of 2 songs that start immediately {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}} great retro(?) flavor!

  </div>
</div>

tatsuro yamashita is one of my favorite artists of all time!! the "king of citypop" has too many hits to list here (and he's still making music!) so here's a classic -- [sparkle by tatsuro yamashita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPJ0EBbXiyQ), as featured in that [giant isopod tumblr post](https://hussainthemvp.tumblr.com/post/171855111948/rocketmermaid-giant-isopods-are-so-cool-but) LMAOOO

  (audio player not supported)
</audio>

since all his songs are getting nuked off youtube{{site.data.foot.t1}} here's a personal upload, my favorite version of [paper doll by tatsuro yamashita](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9325cf467fceb34264d80a6f2bcd9469/be97c4b442b18219-7f/109e81acb0006ed9bedb977f437fcf555db6f6cd.mp3)! a 13-minute LIVE recording packed with awesome keyboard and electric guitar solos!!

in the studio version he sings way softer, almost like he's whispering, which isn't bad -- but i love how he sings fully here, filling the venue!

another upload, [itsuka hareta hini by tatsuro yamashita](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e9cc02ed8cf2135f658cf329fef469fd/8fe563e4494a4c3e-00/8b45c7cb1bccae3e1130824a828deb7ba3d3d405.mp3)! a soft bop with a nice melody...

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h2SQ8QqWM-Q" title="bomber by tatsuro yamashita" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

for a funkier pick, here's [bomber by tatsuro yamashita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2SQ8QqWM-Q)! love how the best vid is a rhythm game beatmap ðŸ˜­ thank you gamers!! also, there's another version that starts with 15 seconds of jackhammer noises for some reason LOL

### misty mauve

<div class="centered" style="max-width:{{page.vidwidth}};">
  <div class="iframecontainer">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhGkZ1AIJa8" title="misty mauve by tatsuro yamashita" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

[misty mauve by tatsuro yamashita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhGkZ1AIJa8) was my favorite tatsuro song for a long while, perhaps because it feels a bit different from his usual! a couple trivias:

1) this was originally written for [masayuki suzuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgtHQtKSizw), with yamashita composing and mariya takeuchi on lyrics! you might recognize masayuki suzuki from the openings of kaguya-sama: love is war, including the super catchy [daddy! daddy! do!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwaZkOXXqw)

2) one of my jojo stands was named misty mauve! to avoid copyright it would be localized as purple haze... which would of course get struck a second time LOL

## morning glory

<div class="centered" style="max-width:{{page.vidwidth}};">
  <div class="iframecontainer">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGD5ByojVVM" title="morning glory by mariya takeuchi" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

a citypop legend covering her husband tatsuro yamashita's song -- [morning glory by mariya takeuchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGD5ByojVVM)! i prefer her version LOL, she has a really smooth voice and effortlessly glides through lower(?) ranges like these!

you've probably heard her ultra popular [plastic love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_lC2O1oIew), a "staple" of the late 2010's citypop renaissance! and for a more dramatic(?) pick showcasing her vocal quality, check out [eki by mariya takeuchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vu7OwWsx3Y)!

## melody for you

<div class="centered" style="max-width:{{page.vidwidth}};">
  <div class="iframecontainer">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPRgTP8_1U0" title="melody for you by toshiki kadomatsu" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

like windy summer, [melody for you by toshiki kadomatsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRgTP8_1U0) flaunts all the appeals of citypop, just slower and smoother! the sax solos are FLAWLESS

[take you to the sky high by toshiki kadomatsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsQ81IkUjCE) comes in extremely close second place, it's so hype LMAO! i'm also a fan of his instrumental album legacy of you, so here's [twilight river by toshiki kadomatsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OQKzYckWDI)!

fun fact: kadomatsu also worked on the anri album at the top of this page, "timely!!"

- {{site.data.foot.b1}} yamashita doesn't put his music on american(?) music streaming services, so they're all unofficial uploads...
