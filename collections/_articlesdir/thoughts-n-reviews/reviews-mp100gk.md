## mob psycho 100

- author: ONE (also made one punch man!)
- web manga / anime debut: 2012 / 2016

IT'S SO GOOD. if you ask for my favorite anime, the answer is mob. it's the masterpiece i never talk or draw about because my brain Only latches onto bad shows {{site.data.emojis.reigen}}

if opm uses "overpowered main character subversion" for comedy, mp100 uses it for drama.

what stood out most to me was how painfully genuine mobbert and friends' troubles and flaws felt, in how specific, grounded, and relatable they were.

pair ONE's excellent writing with perhaps the most stylish, weighty, and impactful animation i've seen{{site.data.foot.t1}}, and i can't imagine mob dropping from my #1 spot any time soon!

(also, i think reigen lives up to his infamy, memes and all, which is saying a lot {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}})

## golden kamuy

- author: satoru noda
- manga / anime debut: 2014 / 2018

i JUST spedran the anime + manga in the year 2024 and was hooked!

one thing about me is that i love information {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}üëç so i had a great time, as gk regularly dives into explaining all sorts of topics: hunting, tracking, food preparation, wilderness survival, historical technologies, ainu culture and mythology, etc.{{site.data.foot.t2}}

gk has a sense of logic and realism i find very appealing. natural hazards Can and Will kill you. the fights are strategic and succinct! ogata's especially were ([kido y4 engdub voice](https://youtu.be/39mw_f3NK9E?t=150)) SO COOL, and the gun strats were awesome (ex: toni and ogata identifying guns / owners by their sound, people dissembling / disabling each others' rifles mid-fight).

the army setting means most characters have history / beef with, or at least know of each other from the start (efficient!), and the way connected players and events were revealed bit by bit was satisfying.

this show is unhinged {{site.data.emojis.reigen}} both the series as a whole (why are these men always naked {{site.data.emojis.enid}}) and the characters themselves my god!!! i have a high bizarreness threshold and i was truly impressed!{{site.data.foot.t3}}

anyway, asirpa is so awesome YAY{{site.data.foot.t4}}, i love her dynamic with sugimoto. i'm also a massive fan of everyone's funky eye / eyebrow shapes :^D

edit: after reading/rereading more of the manga, i'm OBSESSED with the paneling style, it's my new gold standard for fight scenes in comics! actions are concise, never taking 3 panels when 2 will do, and the poses and camera angles are strong and dynamic. the resulting fast-paced intensity is super delicious and fun to read!

  - {{site.data.foot.b1}} not just during flashy fights, but the expressive posing and little movements -- that's where it's at!!! {{site.data.emojis.evil}} the quality of movement OUGH... i could go on forever... but i musn't!

- gk
  - {{site.data.foot.b2}} a "gorey cooking anime" alongside dorohedoro, though this feels more like a "gorey encyclopedia anime" {{site.data.emojis.zenigata}}
  - {{site.data.foot.b3}} the jojo / yakuza fan overlap makes sense -- if you enjoy large, insane, often murderous men, this is the show for you! {{site.data.emojis.reigen}}
  - {{site.data.foot.b4}} one of my peeves is when the kid/girl protag is annoying (LOL) or just a pawn / valuable object everyone else controls... and asirpa is none of that üôè she's silly and smart with her own motivations, and people take her seriously!
