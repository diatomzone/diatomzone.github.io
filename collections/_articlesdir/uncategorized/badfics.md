## overwatch fanfiction

(1064 words)

my name is mercy overwatch. i'm a doctor from sweden (not switzerland) and am 30something years old, with a phd in medicine. i went to university in the united states even though the healthcare system is a travesty... it fills me with despair. but every day i wake up and shuffle to my kitchen to make myself coffee so i have energy to revive the heroes of over watch, which is the company i work at. it's a lively place; for sure.

for starters -- there's a ninja named genji who is also a robot (we are not a couple, ok?) who has a sword and also shurikens and also sometimes (oftentimes) a giant cool dragon who is named, i mean the two or more of them are named bill and ted. they can be pretty scary when they're angry! that's called genji's ultimate.

anyways, today is sunday and genji and i did not go to church because it does not exist in over watch world (not to be cobfused with world wide web). so after we killed a bunch of guys and also pushed the robot (this is called the payload i think) we went out to brunch at ihop! every time i go to ihop i always order the same thing -- that being a stack of normal pancakes, 3 cakes high, with powdered sugar and EXTRA whipped cream. also ice water. my buddy genji orders a latte (vanilla) and nothing else becuase he can't eat sugary pancakes because he's a cyborg.

"you don't know until you try," said genji, unprompted.

"what?" i asked in confusion.

"uhh, nevermind." said genji, hiding his face behind his bowl shaped coffee mug.

anyway, after brunch i decided to meet up with another friend who is named engineer teamfortress 2 -- but before i could order an uber (it's a flying car, if you didn't know) i was so rudely interrupted by none other than moira overwatch!

"well, well, well, who do we have here?" said moira, appearing from a shady alleyway. she smirks evilly. ugh!

"what do YOU want?" i roll my eyes. it's my enemy from medical school, even though she got expelled.

moira (who does evil experiments, which is super not cool and also the reason why she got expelled and also doesn't have a medical license) (becuase she didn't graduate) starts coughing, a whole lot.

"ow, my evil lungs." she chokes. "a-- anyways, mercy, i thought i would ruin your day with something you'll hate." she drinks water out of her scientific erlinmeyer flask.

i won't let her get to me on a beautiful sunday like this! i think.

moira pulls out an oversize dark wood picture frame from behind her back. "guess what? i just got my doctor license!" her smug face is so punchable!

"WHAT??" i cry in shock! that can't be! no way! but upon closer inspection, it IS a real degree, but not from the university of united states -- it's a phd from the university of evil!!!

"speechless, are you not?" moira chuckles. "this means we now stand on equal ground. which is bad news -- for YOU."

i've had enough of this nonsense! i pull out my cool glowing(?) staff and swing it at her head! but she teleports away! that's cheating. the dubious doc reappears behind me!

"what are you plotting?" i growl. "what's your game?"

"i am going open a medical practice... right across the street from yours! and drive you and your pathetic business right out of town!" moira starts laughing evilly yet subuedly. it's... ominous. but i muster a smile.

"...looks like i have nothing to worry about. evil medicine will never prevail against good medicine!"

i hear moira's footsteps turn and walk away down the street. "we'll see about that." and she's gone.

anyway, THAT just happened. what-ever. it's about time to head home!

in an apartment on the other side of town, lucio overwatch is making sick beats on his desktop pc which has cool rgb lights inside, since he made it himself. but all the colors are green and yellow because those are his favorite colors! through his headphones, he hears the door open.

"i'm back!" says mercy.

"hey! i got some takeout for you." lucio calls from his room.

mercy hangs up her jacket and wings and staff and gun and bag and gunbelt and keys on the many many hooks by the door. "you're the best, lucio!"

uh oh. i forgot i was the narrator for a second. i check the fridge and there's some delicius dim sum! score!

lucio swivels his desk chair as i walk in eating some good fuckin food.

"how's it coming along?" i ask, lookign at all the lines and colorful blocks on the screen. it's greek to me, even though i can read some. greek writing, i mean.

lucio shrugs coolly, but with a smile. "pretty good so far! can't wait to drop this album! or, beat, if you will!" (laugh track) (author's note: "album drop" is a skill usable by the musician class in yakuza: like a dragon)

"awesome, i can't wait to check it out when you upload it to the internet!" i wave and take my leave. i should ask sombra to fix my computer when i see her at work next time. i think i downloaded too many malwares!

...

it's night time now. it's dark outside, but warm in the flat thanks to our high-tech plasma space heating unit, which also has rgb lights. i yawn, sleepily.

seated at my medical book-surrounded desk, i catch lucio passing by my room, carrying his cup of ice water. we both really love ice water! "good night, lucio!" he is wearing pajamas with various percussion instrument pattern and a silk lined stocking cap with a pom pom at the end. he waves drowsily.

after what feels like years of reading and writing, i finally close my electronic tablet, having finished my work. i brush and floss my teeth and hop in bed in my pj's (they're ice cream pattern. so cute!), ready for a good nights's rest! which is necessary for a healthy lifestyle, just so you know. i close my eyes, but worry whispers from the back of my mind... why am i letting that dastardy doc's trash talk get to me?! whatever.... it's a beautiful monday tomorrow! let's go!

to be continued...

## final fantasy 7 fanfiction

(350 words)

my name is rude finalfantasy, and i am 33 years old. i live in the northeast platform ofthe midgar stage in the super smash bros ultimate, and sometimes my house gets struck by lightning from the lightning god. thankfully, the lightning rod my associate reno installed in the backyard mitigates (this is an overwatch term) the damage.

reno is sitting on my couch watching the boxy crt telly, and trying to use my email address to sign up for free streaming subscriptions. even though i keep changing my password, he keeps using my email again and again... this is so annoying!

"reno, can you knock it off?" i call from across the living room and kitchen, since i am standing at the sink washing my three coffee mugs. my clear hand soap dispenser has a colorful little plastic parrot inside, clinging to the pump straw.

"sure," says reno, punching at the remote and logging into yet another website. there is a preview of the animated television series "bolonco" that starts playing, and it's very loud. and annoying.

i put away the dishes and close the cupboards gently, despite my increasing irritation. i remove my apron (it was a gift from my freind barret) and hang it up on the wall hook by the convection oven. before i can kick that troublemaker out of my house, the doorbell rings.

i go to it (the door) and open it (with the doorknob). the bright sunlight flooding in does not hurt my eyes at all, thanks to my stylish and polarized 100% uv protection shades. but then my heart jolts in surprise!

"hi rude!" says aerith, standing beside her girlfriend tifa. aerith holds out a blue topped tupperware container. "we made you some cookies. think of it as compensation for the butter and eggs you lent us earlier!" wow, they're too kind!

"thank you." i pop open the tupperware. there are multicolor m&ms in the cookies. "can i try one?" the two nod eagerly.

i take a bite of the warm, crunchy treat, but there's a strange tartness.

they're skittles...

THE END
