"huh? you wanna know why i don't ride a horse?? well LET me give it to you straight: JUST. CAN'T. STAND 'em. big and unwieldy and you can't even drift on 'em AND they poop everywhere like it's their job!! i don't trust 'horses' (air quotes) and they don't trust me, the feeling's mutual. uhhh-huh. they're pretty cute though."
