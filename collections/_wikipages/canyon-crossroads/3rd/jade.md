## trivia

- travels with dozens of notebooks and research tools (conveniently stowed in pocket dimension)
- the scar under her right eye was accidentally self-inflicted. while still figuring out her ability, she teleported an object into her face.
- her deadpan humor plays well with yasu's outrageous one -- they'll often do bits to try and make oridoti crack a smile
