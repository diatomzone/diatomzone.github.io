CANYON CROSSROADS is a fantasy western slice-of-life.

## synopsis

the adventures of travelers, townsfolk, and the tunnel canyon cowpoke gang.

## setting

### canyon crossroads

a scenic outpost of REDTAIL'S BUTTE.

home to our protagonists, canyon crossroads is nestled in the desert foothills where the railroad exits TUNNEL CANYON on its way down to redtail.

once a simple pit stop, canyon crossroads has grown into a small town that sees visitors year-round. quality lodgings and its proximity to the mountains and their forests make it popular with (game, bounty, monster) hunters as well.

according to jade, the number of natural and magical anomalies that occur here is much higher than average.

### tunnel canyon

confusingly, this is a tunnel, not a canyon.

tunnel canyon is a massive, perfectly circular and straight tunnel that bores all the way through the local mountain range. it was formed long ago, but the details are unknown.

as the easiest (flattest) way to cross from one side of the mountains to the other, the train line running through it gets plenty of use.

### redtail's butte

a medium-sized city located in a basin-and-range valley. named for its picturesque butte (not butt) where redtail hawks nest.

canyon crossroads is an hour or two away by train.
