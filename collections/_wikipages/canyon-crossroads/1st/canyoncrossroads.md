## synopsis

the adventures of travelers, townsfolk, and the tunnel canyon cowpoke gang.

## setting

### canyon crossroads

a scenic outpost of REDTAIL'S BUTTE.

the gang's base of operations, CANYON CROSSROADS sits at the mouth of TUNNEL CANYON atop grassy foothills. the railroad passes through (the tunnel and the town) on its way down to redtail.

once a simple pit stop, canyon crossroads has grown into a small town that sees visitors year-round. quality lodgings and its proximity to the mountains and their forests make it popular with (game, bounty, monster) hunters as well.

according to jade, the number of natural and magical anomalies that occur in the surrounding area "is anomalous in itself".

### tunnel canyon

confusingly, this is a tunnel, not a canyon.

tunnel canyon is a massive, perfectly circular and once-perfectly-straight tunnel that bores all the way through the local mountain range. it was formed long ago, but the cause and details are unknown.

as the easiest (flattest) way to cross from one side of the range to the other, the train line running through it gets plenty of use.

### redtail's butte

a medium-sized city located in a basin-and-range valley. named for its picturesque butte (not butt) where redtail hawks nest.

despite the drier climate, redtail is able to support vibrant industry thanks to channeled mountain runoff from both sides and the work of groundwater specialists.

canyon crossroads is roughly two hours by train going uphill, and the way back down is faster.
