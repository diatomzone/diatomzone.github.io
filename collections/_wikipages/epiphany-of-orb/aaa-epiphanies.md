EPIPHANIES are small-scale, highly specific, and relatively impractical supernatural abilities in EPIPHANY OF ORB.

this power system is inextricably rooted in the user's experiences and worldview.

## background

### supernatural energy

SUPERNATURAL ENERGY saturates the planet, just like water or air.

high concentrations distort reality, allowing the laws of physics to be broken -- objects can transform into spheres, steel can be cut like butter, etc...

the ripples of distorted reality can be sensed by nearby epiphany users, monsters, and certain technologies.

### monsters

MONSTERS are beings made of supernatural energy. the more energy they contain the greater their influence over reality, and the stronger their abilities become.

to grow, they can passively absorb from their environment or consume other sources of energy, including epiphany users and each other.

sufficient damage will destabilize a monster's form, destroying it and releasing its energy back into the world.

## epiphany mechanics

### gaining epiphanies

epiphanies change something in the user's brain, allowing them to generate supernatural energy and utilize a specific ability.

an epiphany is triggered by a pivotal character development, usually a conscious change in worldview. the resulting ability is (symbolically or vaguely) related to the user's change.

### using epiphanies

epiphanies and the wider supernatural world are not common knowledge, so not much is known about their causes, variety, limitations, etc.

producing supernatural energy would probably tire you out after a while, though.

like any supernatural activity, epiphanies can attract unwanted attention from monsters and evildoers.

groups with the means to research these things tend to intend to use them for evil...

SPOILERS: if one could figure out how to steal the entirety of a person's memories and experiences, however...

## trivia

- one of my nitpicks is when superpowers and inciting incidents feel impersonalized or random, like the character has no agency. so i'm pleasantly surprised by how the pieces of this power system fell into place!
