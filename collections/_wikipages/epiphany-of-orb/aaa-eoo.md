EPIPHANY OF ORB is one of my oc universes or "stories", which isn't actually a story because it's not planned out at all.

## synopsis

uranium university, 20XX.

bill boatswain was an ordinary student -- pastashapeography major by day and sleeping pastashapeography major by night -- until a rooftop epiphany granted them the power to shape anything they touch into a sphere.

bill soon learns new quark city is a place where supernatural forces hide in plain sight, their newfound ability making them a target for magic-hungry monsters and scheming villains alike.

joined by “magical girl” century blue and wandering enigma fiori ironheart, our three friends must navigate university life, fend off the nefarious henchman zug archaeopteryx, and uncover the nature of their reality-bending "epiphanies".

## setting

### new quark city

a near-future new york city. there are flying bikes and scooters (but not cars due to physics limitations).

### uranium university

the school bill and friends attend. neither prestigous nor unprestigious, but actually quite prestigious if you're a pastashapeographer.

the campus and its bustling college town are located on the edge of new quark city, near the specific ocean (the aquatic ocean is on the west coast).

## media

- eoo anime opening 1
- eoo halloween comic
- friend's oc crossover art

## trivia

- it started with me trying to combine as many overused tropes and nonsensical ideas as possible, then accidentally became compelling
- out of all my ocs, this main cast has the most characterization by far (meaning, more than none)
